üîß Phase 1 ‚Äî MVP: Portfolio Viewer

üß† Goal:

Connect Binance API and display user portfolio per asset.

üî® Components:
	1.	Frontend (React/Next.js preferred):
	‚Ä¢	Simple UI to input API key/secret (via modal or inline form)
	‚Ä¢	Basic asset list (symbol, amount, current price, value in USDT)
	‚Ä¢	Optional: P&L stubbed (zeroed)
	2.	Backend (Node.js or Python FastAPI)
	‚Ä¢	Secure API proxy for Binance REST API
	‚Ä¢	/balance endpoint that:
	‚Ä¢	Authenticates with provided key/secret
	‚Ä¢	Fetches spot wallet balances
	‚Ä¢	Joins with live price feed (via Binance /ticker/price)
	‚Ä¢	Returns enriched asset list to frontend
	3.	Security:
	‚Ä¢	Temporarily store API key in memory or encrypt per session
	‚Ä¢	Later: persist encrypted w/ user wallet signature gating

‚∏ª

‚öôÔ∏è Phase 2 ‚Äî Sell (‚ÄúNuGet‚Äù)

üß† Goal:

Enable user to sell selected assets and log the price + amount.

üß© Features:
	1.	Checkbox selection on portfolio screen
	2.	Sell (‚ÄúNuGet‚Äù) Button ‚Äî triggers:
	‚Ä¢	Market sell of all selected assets
	‚Ä¢	Records:
	‚Ä¢	symbol
	‚Ä¢	sell price (at execution)
	‚Ä¢	quantity sold
	‚Ä¢	timestamp
	3.	Backend Changes:
	‚Ä¢	/sell endpoint:
	‚Ä¢	Validates Binance API keys
	‚Ä¢	Loops over selected symbols
	‚Ä¢	Executes market order via /api/v3/order
	‚Ä¢	Stores sale metadata in lightweight DB (SQLite or Supabase for now)

‚∏ª

üîÅ Phase 3 ‚Äî Buy It Back

üß† Goal:

Repurchase previously sold assets and calculate P&L

üß© Features:
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúBuy It Back‚Äù tab/button
	‚Ä¢	Shows:
	‚Ä¢	Assets not yet bought back
	‚Ä¢	Original sell price, quantity, current price
	‚Ä¢	Calculated P&L = (SellPrice - CurrentPrice) * Qty
	‚Ä¢	User selects which to repurchase
	‚Ä¢	Executes market buy
	‚Ä¢	Updates entry as ‚Äúrepurchased‚Äù

üßÆ Backend:
	‚Ä¢	/buyback endpoint:
	‚Ä¢	Fetches active sell logs
	‚Ä¢	Executes market buy
	‚Ä¢	Marks buyback done, logs timestamp + price

‚∏ª

üìä Phase 4 ‚Äî Realized P&L

üß† Goal:

Show summary of user profit/loss across all trades
	‚Ä¢	List of completed round-trips (sold + bought)
	‚Ä¢	Realized P&L: sum of all P&Ls
	‚Ä¢	Basic charting (optional)
	‚Ä¢	Export as CSV (optional)

‚∏ª

üß† Agent Use Case (Future):

Use AI agent to:
	‚Ä¢	Recommend when to ‚ÄúNuGet‚Äù based on price movements
	‚Ä¢	Simulate ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù buybacks
	‚Ä¢	Alert on significant price drops after sale

‚∏ª

üõ† Stack Recommendation:
	‚Ä¢	Frontend: Next.js + Tailwind + Wagmi (if Solana login added later)
	‚Ä¢	Backend: FastAPI (Python) or Express (Node.js)
	‚Ä¢	Storage: Supabase, Firestore, or PostgreSQL
	‚Ä¢	Security: Encrypt API keys (AES) or use ephemeral sessions
	‚Ä¢	Binance API: REST + WebSocket (optional for real-time)

## Updated Frontend Flow & Requirements

The following user flow and UI requirements are based on the latest design direction and screenshots:

### User Flow
1. **Login / Connect Binance API**
   - User is prompted to enter their Binance API Key and Secret in a secure modal or form.
   - Credentials are stored locally and never shared.
2. **Display Portfolio**
   - After connecting, the user sees a dashboard with their portfolio:
     - Each asset shows: symbol, amount (units), current price, and value in USDT.
     - Total portfolio value is displayed prominently.
3. **Show Realized P/L**
   - Realized profit/loss from completed buy-back trades is shown.
   - Panic History section lists past "Nuke" (sell) and "Buy Back" actions with timestamps and P&L.
4. **Panic Sell (Nuke) Button**
   - Large, prominent button to trigger selling selected assets.
   - User can select which assets to "nuke" (sell).
5. **Buy Back Button**
   - Large, prominent button to trigger repurchasing previously sold assets.
   - User can select which assets to buy back.

### UI/UX Requirements
- Modern, dark-themed dashboard (see screenshots for style reference).
- Responsive layout for desktop and mobile.
- Clear feedback for loading, errors, and successful actions.
- Security notice: API credentials are stored locally and never shared.
- (Optional) Show/hide API secret input.

## Future Improvement Ideas

- Advanced error handling (user-friendly messages for invalid API keys, network errors, etc.)
- Loading spinners or skeleton screens for better UX during data fetch
- Security enhancements (masking API secret, session expiration, etc.)
- Temporarily store API key in memory or encrypt per session (beyond React state)
- UI polish: animations, transitions, and accessibility improvements
- Option to show/hide API secret input
- More detailed portfolio breakdown (e.g., asset icons, price change indicators)
- Support for multiple Binance accounts
- Internationalization (i18n) and localization
- Mobile-first optimizations and PWA support
- Dark/light mode toggle
- Integration with other exchanges or wallets
- User onboarding/help tooltips
- Export portfolio as CSV or PDF
- Customizable dashboard widgets

# Minance: Binance Portfolio Viewer

## Features

- **Single-tab layout**: The main portfolio view now includes both active assets and a "Liquidated Portfolio" section inline, rather than separate tabs.
- **Asset selection and Sell flow**: Click "Sell" to enter selection mode, choose assets, and confirm via a modal before selling.
- **Liquidated Portfolio & Buy Back**: Sold assets appear in the Liquidated section. Click "Buy Back" to select and repurchase assets, with confirmation.
- **Realized and Unrealized P/L**: Realized P/L is tracked and shown for completed trades. Unrealized P/L is shown for liquidated assets as if you had held them.
- **Mobile Responsive**: (To be added) The UI will adapt for mobile screens for easy use on any device.
- **Binance-style UI**: White backgrounds, black text, yellow highlights, and modern card/tab design.
- **Session/local storage**: API keys are stored in sessionStorage; realized P/L and liquidated assets in localStorage.

## User Experience

- **Connect**: Enter your Binance API key/secret (read-only recommended).
- **Portfolio**: View your assets, total value, and realized P/L. Sell assets with confirmation.
